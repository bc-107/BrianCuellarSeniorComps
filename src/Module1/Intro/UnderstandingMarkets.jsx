                    <p className="mb-4 text-xl text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                        Imagine walking into a farmers market. Vendors are selling everything from apples to handmade
                        goods, and buyers, are deciding what to purchase. Buyers are deciding what to purchase—cooks,
                        chefs, and regular people alike. Some haggle for better deals, while others pay full price for
                        something they want. This simple back-and-forth between buyers and sellers is what a market is
                        all about—a system where people exchange goods, services, and value, whether in person, online,
                        or even through financial instruments like stocks.
                    </p>
                    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4"> Why are Markets Important?</h2>
                    <p className="mb-4 text-xl text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                        Markets are the foundation of any economy. They help coordinate how resources are produced,
                        distributed, and consumed. Whether it’s setting the price of apples at your local store,
                        determining global oil prices, or valuing a company’s stock, markets work by balancing two key
                        forces: supply and demand. These forces drive decisions about what gets made, who gets it, and
                        how much it costs.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4"> The Two Key Forces: Supply and Demand</h2>
                    <p className="mb-4 text-xl text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                        At the heart of every market are two main forces:

                        Supply: How much of a product producers are willing to sell.
                        Demand: How much consumers are willing to buy.

                        These forces work together to determine the price and quantity of goods and services available. Understanding supply and demand helps us see why prices go up or down and how markets respond to changes.

                        However, while supply and demand are essential, they represent a simplified view of market interactions. Other elements such as production costs, technological advancements, government policies, and unexpected events like natural disasters also play significant roles in price determination. These additional factors can create complexities that extend beyond the basic framework of supply and demand.

                        For the purpose of this module, we focus on supply and demand to provide a solid foundation for understanding market behaviors. These principles are key to grasping how prices, quantities, and resources are allocated across markets—from everyday goods to financial assets like stocks. As you progress, remember that while supply and demand offer a critical lens for analysis, real-world markets often involve multifaceted dynamics that enrich our understanding of economic interactions.

                                Markets aren't limited to physical places like farmers markets or grocery stores.
                                They exist wherever buyers and sellers interact to exchange value. Online platforms like
                                Amazon or eBay allow people to trade goods from anywhere in the world. Stock exchanges,
                                like the NYSE or NASDAQ, are markets where shares of companies are bought and sold.
                                Even informal systems, such as local bartering between neighbors or trading
                                collectibles,
                                are forms of markets.
